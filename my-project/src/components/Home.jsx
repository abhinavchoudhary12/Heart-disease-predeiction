        medical research. The diagnosis of heart disease is a challenging task, which can offer automated
        prediction about the heart condition of patient so that further treatment can be made effective. The
        diagnosis of heart disease is usually based on signs, symptoms and physical examination of the
        patient. <span className='bg-red-50 'href='/'>There are several factors that increase the risk of heart disease, such as smoking habit, body
        cholesterol level, family history of heart disease, obesity, high blood pressure, and lack of physical
        exercise.</span><br/>
        <br/>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Cardiovascular diseases are very common these days, they describe a range of conditions that could affect
your heart. World health organization estimates that 17.9 million global deaths from (Cardiovascular
diseases) CVDs.
It is the primary reason of deaths in adults. Our project can help predict the people who are likely to diagnose
with a heart disease by help of their medical history. It recognizes who all are having any symptoms of
heart disease such as chest pain or high blood pressure and can help in diagnosing disease with less medical
tests and effective treatments, so that they can be cured accordingly.
